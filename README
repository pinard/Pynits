README file for Pynits
======================

.. contents::

Pynits is a tool which I find useful while editing Python source code
with Vim, for tidying up individual sources lines.  It is particularily
helpful when formatting lines holding long or complex expressions.

The documentation is kept in file `pynits.txt`__, which you may browse or
print, yet it is meant for the Vim help system.  Once the installation
is completed as per the steps described below, and from within Vim, you
may quickly get back to the documentation through the command::

    :help pynits

Pynits messages are also available in French, given the ``LANG``
environment variable is ``fr`` or a variant of ``fr``, before you call
Vim.

On Windows or other non-Unix systems
====================================

You likeley have fetched a recent ``.zip`` archive from:

    http://fp-etc.progiciels-bpi.ca/archives

Choose the directory where you want the files installed.  This is
normally one of the directories listed by VIM command::

    :set runtimepath

Let's call it :file:`DIRECTORY`.  Create :file:`DIRECTORY` if it does
not exist and unzip the distribution you got into :file:`DIRECTORY`.
For making the documentation available to VIM, execute VIM commands::

    :helptags DIRECTORY/doc

replacing ``DIRECTORY`` in the command above, of course.

You have to manage in such a way that Python will successfully import
file :file:`python/pynits.py`.  One way is changing your Python
installation so it will look in that directory.  See your Python
documentation for knowing where the directory :file:`site-packages/` is,
then add these lines to file file:`.../site-packages/sitecustomize.py`::

    import sys
    sys.path.append('DIRECTORY/python')

once again replacing ``DIRECTORY`` as appropriate, above.  Another way
is to move the just installed file :file:`python/pynits.py` into another
directory on the Python import search path.  Pick a directory among
those Python lists when you interactively execute::

    import sys
    print sys.path

A third way might be to preset ``PYTHONPATH`` in the environment so this
variable points to :file:`DIRECTORY/python`.

Finally, you should edit file :file:`DIRECTORY/ftplugin/python.vim` --
create such a file if it does not exist already -- and make sure it
holds at least the following line::

    python import pynits

On Unix or Linux systems
========================

On Linux or other Unix systems, you might follow the instructions above,
meant for non-Unix systems, they should work as well.  Or else, you may
fetch a recent ``.tgz`` archive from:

    http://fp-etc.progiciels-bpi.ca/archives

You may either install this tool for yourself only, or for all users in
your system.

Personal installation
---------------------

This tool may be installed for yourself only, and this might be your
only choice if you do not have super-user privileges.  Merely type
``make install-user`` from the unpacked ``pynits`` distribution.  As a
separate step, your ``~/.vimrc`` file should be modified, or created if
necessary, so it holds the following lines::

    if has('python')
      python <<EOF
    import os, sys
    sys.path.append(os.path.expanduser('~/.vim/python'))
    EOF
    endif

System wide installation
------------------------

If you have super-user privileges, this tool may be installed
system-wide, for all users.  Before doing so, you have to find out
what is the ``$VIM`` value for your installation.  Within Vim, ask::

    :echo $VIM

Let's presume the listed value is :file:`DIRECTORY`.  Then within a shell,
execute the following command::

    make install-root VIM=DIRECTORY

This will use :file:`$VIM/vimfiles/`, which is the standard location for
local site additions.  If you do not like this choice, then modify
file :file:`Makefile` as you see fit.

You also have to manage so Python will know how to import modules from
the :file:`$VIM/vimfiles/python/` subdirectory.  You may find a few
hints about how to do this by looking at the last half of the section
`On Windows and other non-Unix systems`, above.
